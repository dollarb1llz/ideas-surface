      <p>
        <span>The greatest feeling is knowing you got up before the sun.</span>
        <span>It's hard, but it's like the most important key to success.</span>
        <span>It helps to prepare clothes and just actions in general the night before.</span>
        <span>It's also very rewarding to take advantage of the silence of the morning by deep breathing outside.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>The magical potion of healing is a great way to start the day. </span>
        <span> I just need something to fill the gap between making the brew.</span>
        <span>Drink as much water and tea as you can.</span>
        <span>And then make sure to read, watch and strum the guitar.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>I like to watch videos to learn.</span>
        <span>And when I watch educational videos, it's very rewarding.</span>
        <span>You can literally learn anything, but I make sure I stick to the important videos first like coding.</span>
        <span>Also have to beware of the possibility to get caught up in some titties.</span>
      </p>
        <img class="right" src="./res/img/face-flip-plant.gif" />
      <p>
        <span>Getting passed the Tea process without eating is key man.</span>
        <span>Eating makes me unable to stretch.</span>
        <span>If I can't stretch, I feel very unfulfilled.</span>
        <span>And that's no way to start the day.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Getting to work on time is another great way to feel good.</span>
        <span>When we get there on time, we work harder and everything seems so more legit</span>
        <span>Then you just have to make sure you make circles and code in that order.</span>
        <span>If we can get to Giant Eagle and grab some lettuce for dinner yeah.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Throughout the day I want to focus on a few things that will make me feel good at the end of the day.</span>
        <span>I want to keep an eye on my posture, keeping my core engaged whenever possible.</span>
        <span>Also try to BE as relaxed as possible all day, like slow movements and relaxed tone.</span>
        <span>The other thing I want to make sure I do is to just shut up and smile.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>To end the day is as important as the begining of the day.</span>
        <span>Work on your Skating, Basketball and Fitness and Spiritualality.</span>
        <span>Update yourself on what you've accomplished and plan for the next day with BxH.</span>
        <span>A brisk walk comboed with a bath and deep breathing makes for a good sleep.</span>
